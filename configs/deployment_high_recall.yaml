# Deployment Configuration: High Recall Mode
#
# Operating point: TPR ≥ 90%, FPR ≤ 13%
# Use case: When missing evidence is costly (e.g., clinical review)

# Notes
notes: |
  This configuration prioritizes not missing any evidence (high TPR).
  Trade-off: Higher false positive rate means more no-evidence queries
  will be incorrectly flagged as having evidence.

  Recommended for:
  - Clinical review workflows where missing evidence is critical
  - Initial screening where false positives will be filtered downstream
